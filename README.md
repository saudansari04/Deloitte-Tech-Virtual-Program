# Deloitte-Tech-Virtual-Program

Throughout the assigned tasks, I gained valuable skills and knowledge in various areas. Here is a summary of my accomplishments:

Task 01 - Coding:
I successfully manipulated JSON files in Python and used the unittest framework to write and run tests for Python code.

Task 02 - Data Analysis:
Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard to analyze telemetry data from Daikibo's four factories, determining the location with the highest machine breakage and identifying the most frequently breaking machines in that location.

Task 03 - Development:
I drafted a comprehensive software development proposal for Daikibo, outlining the steps to build a real-time manufacturing status dashboard.

Task 04 - Cyber Security:
By analyzing web log files, I identified suspicious requests in Daikibo's intranet dashboard, raising concerns about potential security breaches.

Task 05 - Forensic Technology:
I assisted Daikibo in investigating gender pay inequality by utilizing Excel functions to analyze and quantify the level of gender pay equality across job roles and company locations.

These tasks provided me with practical experience and enhanced my skills in coding, data analysis, software development proposals, cyber security, and forensic technology.
